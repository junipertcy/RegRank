# regrank/utils/__init__.py

# You can optionally define a public API here, but it's not required.
# If you want to allow `from regrank.utils import plot_hist`, you can do:
# from .plotting import plot_hist
# from .reporting import print_summary_table

# But avoid wildcards and long lists.
# It's often better to just have other files do:
# from regrank.utils.plotting import plot_hist
