**Regularized_SpringRank** implements a collection of regularized, convex models (+solvers) that allow the inference of hierarchical structure in a directed network, which exists due to dominance, social status, or prestige. Specifically, this work leverages the time-varying structure and/or the node metadata present in the data set.
